# Wavefront

A small project I worked on, the code above is a wavefront pathfinding algorithm written in Java. The way the algorithm works is from a starting point it takes any surrounding space that the object can move to (North, South, East, West) and marks it with a number, at the start the number will be 1. From each space the algorithm will then mark the surrounding space with the next number and this process repeats until the map is entirely filled. When marking spaces, spaces marked 99 and 101 are ignored as they represent the ending and starting point respectively and already marked spaces are ignored, some spaces in the base 2D array will be marked with a large number to represent some sort of obstacle. From the destination it will pick the shortest path from A to B by taking the adjacent space marked with the lowest number and working its way backwards to the starting point by finding the next adjacent space with a number 1 lower than the number marked on the current space. As the algorithm works its way from point B to A it adds the directions to get to the destination to a list of directions and when the algorithm has finished the user will have a list of directions to get from the starting to destination point as quickly as possible
